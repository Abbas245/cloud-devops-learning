# Week 3 — Git & Version Control

Contents:
- week3-git/             -> local Git labs (branching, undo, merge, etc.)
- git-week3/             -> additional Git practice
- git-week3-integration/ -> integration project (end-to-end Git workflow)

Outcome:
- Confident with branching/merging, undo workflows, tags, remotes, conflict resolution, and minimal rebase.
